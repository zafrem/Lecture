# Building an Education Assistant Agent

Welcome to the class! In this series, we will build an AI-powered assistant to help teachers manage their classrooms and ensure educational equity.

## The Goal
To create a software agent that acts as a:
1.  **Secretary**: Managing schedules and tasks.
2.  **Monitor**: Identifying students who need help.
3.  **Bridge**: Anonymously relaying student feedback.

## Course Structure

### [Step 1: Concept & Design](01_Concept_and_Design.md)
Understanding the problem ("One-to-Many") and designing the "Brain, Memory, Mouth" architecture.

### [Step 2: Designing the Memory](02_Designing_Memory.md)
Learning about Databases (SQLite) and designing schemas for Students, Schedules, and Feedback.

### [Step 3: Building the Brain](03_Building_the_Brain.md)
Implementing the core logic: Parsing natural language commands and creating the "Daily Monitor" loop.

### [Step 4: Interfaces & Integration](04_Interfaces_and_Integration.md)
Connecting our agent to the real world using Discord and Email APIs.

### [Step 5: Use Cases & Examples](05_Use_Cases_and_Examples.md)
Exploring real-world scenarios where this agent promotes equity and efficiency: from the "Equity Guardian" to the "Safe Space" feedback loop.
