# AI Agent

This directory explores the development and implementation of AI Agents. An AI Agent is a system that uses an LLM (Large Language Model) as its "brain" to perceive its environment, reason through tasks, and take actions using various tools.

## Projects

### [🎓 Education Assistant](./Education_Assistant/README.md)
A specialized AI Agent designed to support teachers by managing student interactions, monitoring participation, and handling administrative tasks via Discord and Email.

- **Goal**: Promote educational equity through AI-driven classroom management.
- **Key Features**: Discord integration, database-backed memory, automated reporting, and student engagement tracking.

## Core Concepts

- **Perception**: Receiving input from users or environment (e.g., Discord messages, emails).
- **Reasoning**: Planning and decision-making using LLMs.
- **Action**: Executing tasks via tools (e.g., sending emails, querying databases).
- **Memory**: Maintaining context over time using databases or vector stores.
