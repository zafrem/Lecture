# Security Tools

Practical Python tools for security professionals and system administrators to analyze logs, scan networks, and search for sensitive data.

## Toolset

- **[Error Pattern Extractor](error_pattern_extractor.py)**: Extracts and summarizes error/warning patterns from various log formats (Syslog, Apache, Nginx, Python, Java). Helps in identifying recurring issues or potential attack patterns.
- **[File Search](file_search.py)**: A utility to search through file systems for specific patterns, commonly used for finding exposed secrets, credentials, or specific configuration vulnerabilities.
- **[Log Frequency Analyzer](log_frequency_analyzer.py)**: Analyzes the frequency of log events to detect anomalies, such as brute-force attempts or sudden spikes in error rates.
- **[Subnet Scanner](subnet_scanner.py)**: A fast network scanner to discover active hosts and open ports within a specified subnet.
- **[Time-based Log Visualizer](time_based_log_visualizer.py)**: Generates visual representations (like timelines or heatmaps) of log events to help identify temporal patterns in security data.
