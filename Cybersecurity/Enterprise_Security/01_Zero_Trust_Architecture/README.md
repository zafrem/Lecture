# Module 1: Foundations of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)

## Overview

This module explores the fundamental shift from traditional perimeter-based security to Zero Trust Architecture. Students will learn why the "castle-and-moat" approach is obsolete and how to implement identity-centric security controls.

## Learning Duration
[To be determined]

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of basic network security concepts
- Familiarity with authentication mechanisms
- Knowledge of enterprise IT infrastructure

---

## Topics

### 1.1 The Death of the Perimeter

**Key Concepts:**
- Evolution from perimeter-based to distributed security
- Cloud migration and remote work impact
- Attack surface expansion
- VPN limitations

**Content Areas:**
- [ ] Historical context of network security
- [ ] Modern threats to perimeter security
- [ ] Case studies of perimeter breach incidents
- [ ] Business drivers for Zero Trust adoption
