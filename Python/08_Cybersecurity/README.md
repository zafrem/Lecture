# Cybersecurity and Vulnerability Analysis

This section covers various aspects of cybersecurity, ranging from fundamental security concepts and implementations to practical tools for security analysis and monitoring.

## [1. Basic Concepts](Basic/)
Fundamental security implementations and best practices in Python.
- **Authentication & Access Control**: Password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2), MFA, JWT, and RBAC.
- **Encryption**: Symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques.
- **Network Security**: Secure communication and network-level protections.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identifying and evaluating security weaknesses.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Tracking and analyzing system events for security.
- **Infrastructure Security**: Securing the underlying systems and environment.
- **Incident Response**: Procedures and scripts for responding to security breaches.

## [2. Security Tools](Tools/)
Practical Python tools for security analysis, log processing, and network scanning.
- **Error Pattern Extractor**: Analyzing log files for security-related errors.
- **File Search**: Searching for sensitive information or specific file patterns.
- **Log Frequency Analyzer**: Identifying anomalies in log event frequencies.
- **Subnet Scanner**: Discovering devices and services on a network.
- **Time-based Log Visualizer**: Visualizing security events over time.
