# Lecture Python Class

There are several ways to build basic competencies.

For example, when learning golf, you start by practicing the form, then move onto the field to enjoy the game. However, if you spend too much time perfecting your stance at the beginning, you might lose interest and quit.

When I saw indoor golf, I thought, **"If I can have fun, I'll be more motivated to learn and better handle the challenges along the way."**

So, I decided to write some code to test this idea with an example.
